1. describing your idea,<br/>
I used pytrends API because I thought that it's much easier to make this function when I searched about the solution of it.

2. the amount of time you spent on finishing the program code (or pseudo code),<br/>
1h45m<br/>
If I include research time and debugging time, it will be about 3h.

3. the different ways you have tried to approach the TECH ASSESSMENT,<br/>
I checked DataForSeo's one as well, but I needed to SignUp when I used it. That's why I avoided it.<br/>
I also checked the way of Node.js, however, I could get more information of pytrends than it. Therefore, I had decided to use pytrends.

4. the reasons of settling on the current approach, and finally,<br/>
These reasons made me decide to use pytrends. I thought that I had to make it flexibility such as using argv data. But I did not to do so since it was not mentioned.

5. how to execute your program.<br/>
 - npm run start:back-end
